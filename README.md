# Technology-Valley
So, now the modpack is not just a set of mods, but a full-fledged step-by-step development story.
Your game does not start in the Overworld, but in The Aether, where the main task is to quickly progress from the very first elements of the game to the Catalyst that will help you leave The Aether and move into the Overworld, called the Valley of Technology!
The Valley is a storehouse of adventures necessary for your progress in Technology. As they progress, you will touch on Magic, Other worlds (of which there are a lot in the build) and, of course, Battles with various mobs and bosses!
